                    <p> The hospital was established in 1947. There have been patients that travel across the country to receive the best medical treatment from the leading surgeons in <br>
                        their field and the hospital is reportedly the best in Washington State. <br> <br>

                        After being ranked 12th in top teaching hospitals for a surgical residency program, previously rancked 1st, and being demoted to Level II Trauma Center, the <br>
                        Chief was determined to do everything in his power to restore the hospital's former glory. Surgical protocol was changed, more impressive and news grabbing, <br>
                        but risky, surgeries were actively encouraged and as such, was delighted when Derek and Meredith's clinical trial was featured in a medical journal following <br>
                        its success, being hailed as the Shepherd method. Although there was much success, some people felt he had changed slightly and was acting recklessly, The <br>
                        hospital then merged to another hospital Mercy West Medical Center forming the new Seattle Grace-Mercy West Hospital <br> <br>

                        Seattle Grace Hospital and Mercy West Medical Center were originally two separate medical facilities, but in 2009, due to economic climate, they merged <br>
                        to form one medical facility. Due to the merger and large amount of staff between sites, many employees were laid-off due to "budgetary constraints" both <br>
                        before and after the merger (notably Dr. Isobel Stevens and Dr. April Kepner). <br> <br>

                        Seattle Grace-Mercy West Hospital was a teaching hospital in Seattle, Washington. It was later renamed to Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital. <br> <br>

                        Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital was formed by the new board of directors, the survivors of the plane crash, plus Callie and Jackson in Transplant Wasteland <br>
                        when they decided to rename the hospital as part of their new image for the hospital. The name honors the very reason they have the hospital in the first place <br>
                        and memorializes the two doctors killed in the plane crash, Lexie Grey and Mark Sloan. <br>

                        The building has been renamed twice: It was initially Seattle Grace Hospital, then became Seattle Grace-Mercy West Hospital after merging with Mercy-West <br>
                        Medical Center, and finally renamed Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital after the plane crash survivors and the Harper Avery Foundation bought it. <br> <br> <br> <br>
